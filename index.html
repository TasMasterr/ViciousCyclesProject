    <h1>Our Philosophy</h1>
    <p>Our philosophy is that when you choose your bike, you should choose it based on the folks who will not only build your bicycle, but also those who will help you get comfortable on the bike, as well as provide service down the road as you need it.</p>
    <p>The best things in life are pretty simple. Riding bikes with friends, discovering new places and finding new trails are definitely included. Riding bikes helps us to disconnect from the hectic and noisy world and connect with friends, nature and ourselves. It might just be the best thing ever.</p>
    <p>Technological advancement, digital exploration and the growing globalization defines the world we live in and will bring more change in the years to come than ever before. It’s a world full of uncertainties where it’s easy to get lost. But bikes are a very rare breed of products that are completely mechanical and analogue. There aren’t many products that are so simple yet so sophisticated in their designs. Maybe that is what started my excitement for bikes as products. The process of observing, designing, improving, engineering and producing bikes surely is the second-best thing ever.</p>
